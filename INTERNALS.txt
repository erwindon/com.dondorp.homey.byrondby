The internal sound selector button generates another 2 codes, but can only be operated by opening the pushbutton shell.

=== protocol ===
The (supported) Byron DBY series push buttons and chimes use the 433MHz-based protocol. It uses a simple message consisting of 32 bits for the push button identification. This gives 4.294.967.296 possible IDs.

Please tell me when you have a Byron DBY device that is properly working with Homey, but which is not yet marked as 'tested' here.
